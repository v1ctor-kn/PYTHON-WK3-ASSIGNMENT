# ðŸ§® Discount Calculator in Python

This project is a simple yet practical Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It demonstrates basic conditional logic, user input handling, and function usage in Python. The discount is only applied if the percentage is **20% or higher**, making it a great example of rule-based decision-making.
